# story
- returning home after many years
- see friend megan from school
- she looks almost the same but something in her eyes is diff
- she compliments me and asks me if i've been going to the gym
- i say thanks, but i still have a long way to go
- the changes deeper than the skin are harder to see, but maybe she's changed in ways that I can't tell either
- yes i know she has
- dad interrupts about rotisserie chicken
- hey, this is what your mom asked for right
- wonder when they started selling rotisserie chickens in gas stations
- don't think my mom will be pleased to see this dried husk of chicken, 'it looks fine dad'
- all right, then let me ring up and lets go
- all right see ya megan
- i catch a glimpse of dissapointment in her eyes
- should i ask for her number?
- nah, let's just headout
- i head out into the atrium
- when suddenly a siren attacks my eardrums
- i can't think, feel or move.i'm frozen in agony
- my dad freezes, son do you see that?
- i don't see anything
- suddenly a patter of leaves and small stones hit the window
- a wave of heat hits my face, somehow making its way from outside through the panes of glass
- searing the tips of my eyelashes
- i start to see the faint wisp of a mushroom cloud far away in the horizon
- suddenly meghan pushes her way into the atrium too
- i can't believe it finally happened, it's all over
- she turns around and breaks the glass over some sort of release that i hadn't seen before
- suddenly a huge weight drops in my stomach, it feels like a hand has reached into my lungs and pulled all th air out
- everything outside is replaced by concrete
- i try to gasp out 'Megan, what the hell is happening?'
- but i'm not even able to manage a croak
- my dad's legs collapse from the pressure
- suddenly with a thud the platform stops moving
- all three of us hit the floor
- but before i can collect my thoughts i feel megan's grip on my forearm
- she grabs me and hauls me off the platform
- i help get my dad
- suddenly the platform is gone again with a cloud of dust
- at first it's too dark to see anything
- i step out and touch one of the walls
- what is that!
- i pull my arm back and after a slight resistance it pulls off
- i try to wipe off whatever is on my fingertips on my jeans
- it barely comes off
- suddenly i hear a grating and clanking coming from far away
- my dad shouts out 'hello, is someone there? can you help us?'
- I turn to Megan and ask here, 'hey, what happened outside? where are we?'
- She peers into my eyes, tears threatning to spill
- 'It wasn't supposed to happen, everything above is gone. everyone we know is dead'
- the grating and clanking gets louder
- suddenly it speeds up with a ferocity
- i look down, i feel something grasp my leg tightly
- i kick out but whatever it is won't let go
- it has grasped me like a man in a desert with his last glass of water
- i fall down, suddenly my head hits something
- i grab it with both hands and start pounding on the thing around my leg
- it feels like hitting a balloon filled with blood
- i feel somethin yield and the pressure around my leg decreases
- all that's left is a patch of purple slime around my leg
- suddenly i hear a whistling coming from behind
- 'Some others must have made it!' Megan shouts
- but before the platform lands there is a crunch and a splatter
- the smell of blood and gristle
- a toddler walked towards the wall and fell through the gap
- everyone gets off
- megan tells everyone to follow her
- i hear a squelching sound
- i look over and i see the most beautiful pair of lips i have ever seen
- shining violet eye, i can't look away, obvious intelligence
- embedded in a wall of purple slime
- suddenly there are tendrils grasping my nech and around my left armpit
- thin lines of fire that burn into my skin and through my clothes
- i try to push away
- i feel megan grasp my hand and pull
- but the lines just dig deeper into me
- 'Megan, don't let go! hit them with the pipe!'
- 'I'm sorry, if we stay then we'll all be food for this beast'
- I try to strangle her hand in my grasp but it slips away
- suddenly more tendrils make their way onto my face
- they force their way in through my nostrils
- down my throat
- and into my eyesockets
- i try to cough the slime out but somehow it only works its way deeper into me
- the taste of gasoline drowns my mouth
- i hear a quiet whisper, i can't pinpoint where it comes from
- 'let go my friend, let go of your earthly tether and be free'
- i scream, or atleast try to, 'no, i want to live, where are the others? how could they leave me?'
- 'dad!'
- suddenly my body sags
- i realize that i haven't been able to breathe for a long time
- longer than possible
- the tentacls draw me into the wall
- i'm no longer me
- i'm part of the pit
