- lovecraftian, body horror
- in a gas station
- returning home for first time after many years at college
- see friend Jesse from school
- she looks almost the same but something in her eyes is diff
- she compliments me on getting fit
- i say thanks, but i still have a long way to go
- dad interrupts about rotisserie chicken
- hey, this is what your mom asked for right
- wonder when they started selling rotisserie chickens in petrocanada
- don't think my mom will be pleased to see this dried husk of chicken, 'it looks fine dad'
- all right, then let me ring up and lets go
- all right see ya megan
- i catch a glimpse of dissapointment in her eyes
- should i ask for her number?
- nah, let's just headout
- i head out into the atrium
- when suddenly a siren blares out
- my dad freezes, son do you see that?
